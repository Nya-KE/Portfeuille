        <h3>Intern & Assistant - Mkubwa Media 5/89 Waiyaki Way,Nairobi</h3>
        <p>Work under the Client Service department allowed me the leeway to offer my skills in copy-writing and contentcreation for online platforms,radioandprintads amongst other ATL andBTL advertising services. I find the ideation process for clients' campaigns and organisation of logistics for shoots, experientials and pitches very stimulating. Witnessing the marketing world at large enlightened me the importance of research when releasing and promoting a product or service.
        </p>
        <h3>Volunteer Intern - Safari Doctors Initiative Shela, Lamu</h3>
        <p> My role involved collecting and organizing patient data during outreach clinics, creating and conducting surveys and assisting within the financial and communication departments.
                I got an invaluable scope into the impact of a community outreach project and what it means to construct solutions rooted out of the collectives affected. As well as gain a sound understanding of the cultural dynamics and challenges facing Kenyans living along the coast.
        </p>
        <h3>Freelance Writer/ Content Creator – Datio Specio</h3>
        <p>Involvement with this online writing cooperative has exposed me to creating diverse content and work under strict deadlines. I have worked with turnover times that range from four hours to a day undertaking comprehensive research before producing s containing client specifications. (Kindly find attached a sample )

      <h2>Musings
        <h3>Community Work</h3>
        <p>Currently, I am investing my passion for community work in creating a functioning resident’s association for Mvuli Road, Westlands where I live. It has so far involved a door-to-door campaign, planning meetings and reaching out to local authorities and bodies associated with activities of civic engagement and urban planning. Therefore, I would readily contribute the organizational, social and leadership skills I have been so far exercising to empower the initiative.</p>
        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p> My role as a student and slight auto-didact has been amazing and I would recommend a coding course to anyone who does not want to stop being relevant in their field as technonlogy permeates into all aspects of our lives. Here's the first website I ever made I would like to pursue medicine but I have concerns with my level of commitment towards it, because of competing passions such as writing and work in policy implementation. Yet, I would cherish the opportunity to cultivate interpersonal relationships with people in which I can make tangible and helpful impact
        <h3>PPE</h3>
        <p>My interests would be in politics, internationalism, philosophy and religion. I would like to contribute wider based content featuring speculative and opinionated thought. Generating these sort of s would be complementary to my active consumption of radio, newspaper and online journalism. My YouTube watched list, for instance, is currently occupied by infographics from thought tanks such as the School of Life and the Fifth Estate beside my pop culture forays into music and movies.
